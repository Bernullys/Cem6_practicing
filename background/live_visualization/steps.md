Letâ€™s walk through the setup step by step to build a live dashboard using Grafana + InfluxDB to display data from a sensor. Iâ€™ll keep it simple and explain each part clearly.

ðŸ§­ Overview of What Weâ€™ll Do
We'll build this:

Sensor â†’ Python Script â†’ InfluxDB â†’ Grafana â†’ Live Dashboard

ðŸ”§ Step 1: Install the Tools
1.1 Install Docker (Recommended)
Docker makes everything easier. Youâ€™ll run InfluxDB and Grafana in containers.

Windows/Mac: Install Docker Desktop

Linux: Install Docker from your distroâ€™s package manager

Let me know if you prefer installing without Docker â€” it's possible too.

🔧 Web-Based / Custom Dashboards
These are common for projects where you collect sensor data and show it live, similar to Fronius.

1. Grafana
Grafana is one of the most powerful tools out there for visualizing real-time and historical data, especially for monitoring metrics like energy consumption, temperature, server stats, etc.

Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization platform. It lets you connect to various data sources and build interactive dashboards to monitor your data in real-time.

Think of it like a live "command center" where you can plot sensor data with beautiful charts, gauges, tables, and alerts.

📌 Best for: Real-time dashboards, time-series data (energy, temperature, etc.)

✅ Pros: Highly customizable, supports alerts, plugins, beautiful visuals

💾 Data sources: InfluxDB, Prometheus, PostgreSQL, MQTT, etc.

🌐 Use case: Ideal if you have a database or message queue backend collecting sensor data

🔑 Key Features of Grafana:

| Feature                     | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📊 **Real-Time Dashboards** | Plot sensor data that updates in real time                                 |
| 🔌 **Many Data Sources**    | InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, MQTT, Prometheus, MySQL, JSON API, etc.              |
| ⚠️ **Alerts**               | Trigger alerts via email, Slack, Telegram when thresholds are crossed      |
| 📅 **Time-Series Explorer** | Zoom in/out, select time ranges, compare trends                            |
| 🧩 **Plugins**              | Add extra visualizations or data sources                                   |
| 👥 **User Management**      | Role-based access control for dashboards (great for multi-client projects) |



🧠 If You Want a System Like Fronius Solarweb:
You could build your own version using:

Backend: FastAPI or Node.js

Database: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (for time series)

Frontend: React + Chart.js or Recharts or D3.js

Realtime layer: WebSockets or MQTT


🧠 Typical Use Case (for a Sensor System)
Here’s a typical architecture:


Sensor (e.g., via Modbus, MQTT, HTTP)
      ↓
Data Collector (Python script, Node-RED, Telegraf, etc.)
      ↓
Database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB)
      ↓
Grafana Dashboard (web UI)


🛠️ Example Workflow
Let’s say you’re monitoring energy consumption with a sensor:

Sensor → Sends data every 5s

Data Collector → Python script inserts readings into InfluxDB

Grafana → Queries InfluxDB and updates the dashboard live


📌 Why Use InfluxDB with Grafana?
InfluxDB is built for time-series data (perfect for sensor readings).

It stores values with timestamps and supports downsampling.

Grafana integrates with it seamlessly.


🎨 Dashboard Examples
You can build:

Live line charts (voltage, current, kWh over time)

Bar graphs (daily usage)

Gauges (instantaneous values)

Tables with raw data

Heatmaps (e.g. usage over time of day)


🌍 Deployment Options
Local: Run on your PC or Raspberry Pi (docker run grafana/grafana)

Cloud: Grafana Cloud (free plan available)

Server: Host on VPS or private server


✅ Pros
Open-source and free

Scalable for multiple devices/clients

Clean UI

Alerting and notification system

Secure with user management

❌ Cons
Needs a time-series DB like InfluxDB or similar

Requires some setup (but very manageable)
